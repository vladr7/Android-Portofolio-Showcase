## About Me

Hi! :] I'm Vlad, working as Android Developer since 2021. 

I've starting to really like android development, especially since I begun working with compose, flows and coroutines!! 

Expertise in Android & Kotlin Components:
- Compose (UDF pattern)
- Flows
- Coroutines
- Extension functions
- Compose native navigation 
- Clean architecture
    - Data/Domain/Presentation modules
         - Data contains API's, database stuff
         - Domain is the main logic of the app (usecases & interfaces of repositories)
         - Presentation is the UI (viewmodels & composables/fragments)
    - Data Models: Separate data models for each specific module type
    - Mappers: Transform data from one type to another
    - Use Cases: Used inside ViewModels to handle business logic
    - Viewmodels contain a state object that reflects how the UI looks like and then UI responds back with events (UDF pattern)
    - Repositories/DataSources should always use interfaces so that it's easier to unit test
    - Unit tests (know how to write code that is easily unit testable, that means using a lot of interfaces and single responsability principle)

### Outside of work

I like going outside on walks, play tennis, ski, watch good movies (LOTR is my fav), playing games and recently started creating games for fun :], and reading good books. I also like making jokes and laugh (who doesen't??) :]].

Overall I really enjoy creating stuff, I consider myself an artist and all the Apps/Games are my art. (highly recommend this book about how to make art: [The Creative Act](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act). 

More books I've read are Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Upward Spiral by Alex Korb, Immune by Phipip Dettmer aka Kurzgesagt.. etc. 
If you wish to talk to me for some reason then text me! :]
