## About Me

Hi! :] I'm Vlad, working as Android Developer since 2021. 
I've starting to really like android development, especially since I begun working with compose, flows and coroutines!! I like going outside on walks, play tennis, ski, watch good movies (LOTR is my fav), playing games and recently started creating games for fun :], and reading good books. Overall I really enjoy creating stuff, I consider myself an artist and all the Apps/Games are my art. (highly recommend this book about how to make art: [The Creative Act](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act). 
More books I've read are Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Upward Spiral by Alex Korb, Immune by Phipip Dettmer aka Kurzgesagt.. etc. 
If you wish to talk to me for some reason then text me! :]
